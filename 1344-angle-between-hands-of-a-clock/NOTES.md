To find the angle made by hour hand and minute hand at h : m, where
​
h = number of hours with respect to 12:00
​
(example: 7:12 pm means, h = 7
​
but, 12 : 30 pm means , h = 0 )
​
m = directly enter the minute.
​
Angle = | 11m÷2 – 30h |
Note: If the result is greater than 180° , then substract the result from 360° to get the final result.
